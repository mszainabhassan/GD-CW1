System Outline: 

Our system is an Event Ticket Booking System. Event organizers can effortlessly publish their events, while attendees can conveniently view, and buy tickets to a wide range of events, such as webinars and conferences. The ticket booking system application has three major user roles (Customers, Organizers, and Administrators). The primary stakeholders include "Customer" (users attending events), "Organizer" (users creating and managing events), and "Admin" (system administrator responsible for event approval/rejection). Entities within the system include Events, Customers, Organizers, Admin, Wishlist. 

The use cases are structured around common event management activities. Customers can "View Events," "Book Events," "Add Events into Wishlist," and "Provide Ratings." Organizers have the capability to "Create Events" and "View Events". The Admin has the authority to "Approve/Reject Events" ,"Create Events" and "View Events".
